# SDL-2 set-up

use the CMAKE extension for vscode and select the Visual Studio Community 202X Release amd64_x86 and build, (or build the project with the build.bat file, then enter the build/ directory and click the {project_name}.sln, then build it).
in the deps/ folder, edit the CMakeLists.txt if you plan on adding more libraries to your project.
